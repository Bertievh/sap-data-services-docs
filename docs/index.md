# SAP Data Services

SAP Data Services provides a batch and real-time data integration system to drive today's new generation of analytic and supply-chain management applications. Using the highly scalable data integration solution provided by SAP, the enterprise can maintain a real-time, on-line dialogue with customers, suppliers, employees, and partners, providing the critical information needed for transactions and business analysis.

SAP Data Services combines both batch and real-time data movement and management to provide a single data integration platform for information management from any information source, for any information use.

Using the software, you can:
* Stage data in an operational data store, data warehouse, or data mart.
* Update staged data in batch or real-time modes.
* Create a single graphical development environment for developing, testing, and deploying the entire data integration platform.
* Manage a single metadata repository to capture the relationships between different extraction and access methods and provide integrated lineage and impact analysis.

The SMA OpCon SAP Data Services Connector interacts with the Central Management Console (CMC) through web services to start and track (monitor) jobs defined within the Repository and running on Job Servers within the SAP Data Services environment.
